## Welcome to the SAD's future website

Scrum Board: <a href="https://github.com/aaditgupta21/koolskool/projects/1">Link</a>
### Description: 
With an ever developing internet, we wanted to update our big debate club with a website of their own. As such, we wanted people to have an easier exprience with SAD members for accessing content, so we decided to design a website to organize information and create a better user experience. 

### Things we want to do:
Primary idea is that SAD would be able to use this website and students would be able to view what tournaments and events SAD has planned

 - Homepage: brief gallery of images from all parts of the website, carousel
 - Page for different categories of images by different authors
 - Make your own image using shapes
 - Database - merch ordering
 - Database - event listings
 - Calendar for events
 - Find clubs page
 - Event images
 - Submission of club registration / volunteer hours
 - Snack listing
