### Description: 
With an ever developing internet, we wanted to update our schools older format for their website. As such, we wanted people to ahve na asier exprience with ASB and acessing thier conten , so we decided to design a updated version of thier website ot organize information and create a better user experience. 

### Things we want to do:
Primary idea is that ASB would be able to use this website and students would be able to view what ASB has planned for the school
